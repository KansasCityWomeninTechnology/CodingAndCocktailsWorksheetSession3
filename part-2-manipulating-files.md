#### Create and Edit Files and Directories

1. Change into your home folder with **cd ~**. Use **ls -al** to check if a **CodingandCocktails** folder already exists.
2. If it doesn't, create it using **mkdir CodingandCocktails**. Note that the command line is CASE-SENSITIVE - watch your capitalization!
3. In here, create a **CommandLineBasics** folder with **mkdir CommandLineBasics**.

4. 
5. 1. 1. mkdir, rm dir, touch, vi, cat, wc, char count, cp, mv, find, head, tail
