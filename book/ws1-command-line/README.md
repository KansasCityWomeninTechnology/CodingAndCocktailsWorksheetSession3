# Command Line Basics and Introduction to Git
Tonight we will get comfortable with the command line and learn about version control using Git. 

These concepts are not limited to web development-- the concepts we'll learn tonight are basic building blocks of the development process regardless of the technology stack. Or if you're creating a cocktail, it's the rocks (ice) that binds all the ingredients together in a supporting role.

##### Tonight's Goals
We'll first learn basic command line operations then we'll continue our work in the command line to use a version control system called Git.

# Command Line Basics {#top}
The command line is another way to navigate your computer's directory structure and issue commands. Typically, you have a **GUI**, or **G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface, available to you. Why use a **CLI **\(**C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface\)? Because it's faster, uses fewer resources, and is much more powerful than a GUI! Let's take a look at how to orient yourself with the command line.

The terms CLI and terminal are interchangeable.

Before starting the worksheet, please take a moment to review the [Setup instructions](/setup) to ensure you have all the tools and workspace setup you need for tonight's work.

{% hint style='tip' %}
While following along with the worksheet, type out the commands instead of doing a copy & paste unless explicitly stated to avoid inadvertently using any wrong characters.

This section will help guide you through the following steps:

## Navigate between directories and view files {#navigation} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Being able to confidently navigate the file system via command line is an important first step in becoming a CLI master.

Take a moment to introduce yourself to your neighbors if you haven't already. Your neighbors will be your support network tonight. The bonus assignment requires a buddy so learn each other's Slack handles. To help break the ice, ask your neighbors "If you were famous, what would you be famous for"?

## Tab Completion {#tabcompletion} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Using **tab completion** with your **Tab** key and your **up/down** arrow keys makes using the CLI faster. Tab completion allows you to enter in part of a filename or directory name and when you press `Tab` the rest of the file or directory name automatically populates. We'll use the up/down arrows later in this section.

Let's try our hand at incorporating these shortcut techniques.

## Creating directories and files {#create} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Now that we know how to navigate in the file system, let's try creating files and directories ourselves.
{% include "./3create.md" %}

## Move and delete files and directories {#move-delete} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Let's now work with `cp` and `rm` to make copies of our file and remove files. We'll also try out some helpful CLI commands.
