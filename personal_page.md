# Personal Page

Once you feel like you’ve had enough practice in the command line feel free to get back to your personal website project we started last month. If you didn’t get to join us last month view our HTML &amp; CSS presentation at [http://kansascitywomenintechnology.github.io/IntroToHTMLAndCSS/#/](http://kansascitywomenintechnology.github.io/IntroToHTMLAndCSS/#/). Check out our developer tool guide here ([http://codingandcocktails.kcwomenintech.org/sessions#tools](http://codingandcocktails.kcwomenintech.org/sessions#tools)) for all the tools to make your developer life easier!

1.  Create a folder/directory in your **CodingAndCocktails** directory to house your project in
2.  Open the folder in Sublime Text then create and save a new file as **index.html**
3.  Set up your basic HTML page syntax and set your page title (hint: use the emmet plugin here and all you have to type is html:5 then hit the tab key)
4.  Some ideas to include in your page:
    1.  Put your name at the top in an ``h1`` tag
    2.  Add a paragraph telling a little bit about yourself
    3.  Add a brief paragraph about where you want to go next as a professional
    4.  Add a list of your favorite links
    5.  Add your contact information, link to your linkedin profile, github repositories or twitter page.
    6.  Add a “currently” section to list what you are currently reading, learning and/or listening to
5.  Create an **index.css** page
6.  Link to your **index.css** page in your **index.html** page
7.  Start adding styles to your page!
    1.  change your background color
    2.  change the text styles
8.  **BONUS:** Store your code on github - feel free to ask mentors for help in getting this working for you!
9.  **ALTERNATE MISSION:** Work through the HTML &amp; CSS course on codecademy
10.  Ask as many questions as you can think of - there are no stupid questions and we’ve all probably had the same questions when we were getting started!
