# Command Line Basics {#top}
The command line is another way to navigate your computer's directory structure and issue commands. Typically, you have a **GUI**, or **G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface, available to you. Why use a **CLI **\(**C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface\)? Because it's faster, uses fewer resources, and is much more powerful than a GUI! Let's take a look at how to orient yourself at the command line.
{% hint style='info' %}
The terms CLI and terminal are interchangeable.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style='danger' %}
Before starting the worksheet, please take a moment to review the [Setup instructions](/setup) to ensure you have all the tools and workspace setup you need for tonight's work.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style='tip' %}
While following along with the worksheet, type out the commands instead of doing a copy & paste unless explicitly stated to avoid inadvertently using any wrong characters.
{% endhint %}

This section will help guide you through the following steps:

## Navigate between directories and view files {#navigation} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Being able to confidently navigate the file system via command line is an important first step in becoming a CLI master. 
{% include "./1navigation.md" %}

## Tab Completion {#tabcompletion} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Using **tab completion** with your **Tab** key and your **up/down** arrow keys makes using the CLI faster. Tab completion allows you to enter in part of a filename or directory name and when you press `Tab` the rest of the file automatically populates. We'll use the up/down arrows later in this section.

Let's try our hand at incorporating these shortcut techniques.
{% include "./2tabcompletion.md" %}

## Creating directories and files {#create} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Now that we know how to navigate in the file system, let's try creating files and directories ourselves.
{% include "./3create.md" %}

## Move and delete files and directories {#move-delete} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Let's now work with `cp` and `rm` to make copies of our file and remove files. We'll also try out some helpful CLI commands and shortcuts using your up/down arrow keys to scroll through previous commands. 
{% include "./4move-delete.md" %}
