### Overview

The command line enables developers to work quickly and efficiently. It's a powerful way to create and manipulate files. We'll get comfortable interacting with the filesystem in a text based way!

We'll also learn about version control to maintain code history and enables developers to work together on the same files.

These concepts are not limited to web development-- the concepts we'll learn tonight are basic building blocks of the development process regardless of the technology stack. Or if you're creating a cocktail, it's the rocks (ice) that binds all the ingredients together in a supporting role.
