Or if you're creating a cocktail, it's the rocks (ice) that binds all the ingredients together in a supporting role. \nTonight's Goals\nWe'll first learn basic command line operations then we'll continue our work in the command line to use a version control system called Git.\n\n\n\nCommand Line Basics \nThe command line is another way to navigate your computer's directory structure and issue commands. Typically, you have a GUI, or Graphical User Interface, available to you. Why use a CLI (Command Line Interface)? Because it's faster, uses fewer resources, and is much more powerful than a GUI! Let's take a look at how to orient yourself with the command line.\nThe terms CLI and terminal are interchangeable.\n\n\n \nBefore starting the worksheet, please take a moment to review the Setup instructions to ensure you have all the tools and workspace setup you need for tonight's work.\n\nWhile following along with the worksheet, type out the commands instead of doing a copy & paste unless explicitly stated to avoid inadvertently using any wrong characters.\n\n\n \nThis section will help guide you through the following steps:\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                Navigate and view files\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Use command line shortcuts\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Create files\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Move and delete files\n                \n        \n    \n\n\nNavigate between directories and view files  \nBeing able to confidently navigate the file system via command line is an important first step in becoming a CLI master. \nTake a moment to introduce yourself to your neighbors if you haven't already. Your neighbors will be your support network tonight. The bonus assignment requires a buddy so learn each other's Slack handles. To help break the ice, ask your neighbors \"If you were famous, what would you be famous for\"?\n\nThe  icon tells you when to press Enter.\n\n\nOpen a terminal for your OS. For Windows, open Cmder. For Macs, open iTerm2.\n\nIn your terminal, type pwd  in your CLI to see your current directory. pwd stands for print working directory. \nYou should be in your home directory. For Macs, you should see ~ after your prompt. For Windows, you should see C:\\Users\\ above the lambda (Î»). We will refer to this directory as your home directory in the remainder of the worksheet.\n\n\nOpen a file explorer by using the following command for your operating system (select the tab for your operating system)\n MacWindowsopen .start .\n Being able to visualize your work will help reinforce concepts. View the worksheet, terminal, and file explorer for the command line section of the worksheet all at the same time by adjusting application layout. \nWe want to lay out our workspace to look like this.\n\nFor Windows users, use windows key + left arrow or windows + right arrow to resize the application and position to the left or right half of your screen.\nFor Mac users, hold down the full-screen button in the upper-left corner of a window to shrink and position to the left or right side of the screen. Release the button, then click another window to begin using both windows side by side.\nMentors are happy to help!\n\n\nIn the terminal, type ls  to see the contents of your current directory. You should see the same files in the terminal as you see in the explorer.\n\nNext, change directory into the \"CodingAndCocktails\" directory listed in the output of ls by typing cd CodingAndCocktails . Navigate to your \"CodingAndCocktails\" directory in the file explorer.\nIf you don't have a \"CodingAndCocktails\" directory, take a moment to set up your workspace.\n \nBoth Cmder and oh-my-zsh use formatting to distinguish between what's a directory and what's a file. You won't be able to cd into a file.\n\n\nIn the \"CodingAndCocktails\" directory, type ls  again to see what's listed there. You should see the same files and folders from the output of ls in the file explorer.\n\nType ls -al  and compare it to your previous output.  You should see more information and all files, including hidden files.\nA hidden file is something that isn't normally visible. Examples are files prefixed with ., such as profile files. We'll learn more about profile files later in the worksheet. You'll also see . and ... These are special files representing your current directory and parent directory.\n\n\nLet's move back up one directory-- the parent directory of \"CodingAndCocktails\". To do this, type cd .. .\n The .. is a shortcut for the parent directory. A parent directory would be the directory that contains your current directory. No matter where you are, cd .. is always a valid command.\n\n\n\nTab Completion  \nUsing tab completion with your Tab key and your up/down arrow keys makes using the CLI faster. Tab completion allows you to enter in part of a filename or directory name and when you press Tab the rest of the file or directory name automatically populates. We'll use the up/down arrows later in this section.\nLet's try our hand at incorporating these shortcut techniques.\n\nType in cd Cod then press Tab . Tab completion will find your \"CodingAndCocktails\" folder and fill in the rest of the directory name for you!\n\nNavigate back to your home directory by following the instructions below for your OS and press Enter.\nMacWindowscd ~cd %USERPROFILE%\nNo matter where you are, your OS shortcut to the home directory is always a valid command.\n\n\nPress the up arrow twice and then  to repeat a previous command. You're back in the \"CodingAndCocktails\" directory!\nDepending on your terminal, your command history saves between sessions (each time you boot your computer). You can hit up arrow in your terminal to run the last command in your history. Next time you restart your computer try it out!\n\n\n\nNow try navigating around on your own! See the video below for some help. You can watch it in fullscreen as well. To download the video, right-click and click \"Save video as...\".\n  \n  \n  \n    To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that\n    supports HTML5 video\n  \n  \n\n\nCreating directories and files  \nNow that we know how to navigate in the file system, let's try creating files and directories ourselves.\n\nNavigate back to the \"CodingAndCocktails\" folder in your home directory. Open \"CodingAndCocktails\" folder in the file explorer. \n\nCreate a \"session3\" folder by using the make directory command. Type in mkdir session3 . Do you see your new folder in the explorer?\n\nChange directory into your newly created \"session3\" folder by typing cd session3 . Navigate into \"session3\" in your file explorer.\n\nLet's create a file by typing touch CLIFun.txt . Do you see your file in the explorer?\n\n\nMove and delete files and directories  \nLet's now work with cp and rm to make copies of our file and remove files. We'll also try out some helpful CLI commands. \n\nType cp CLIFun.txt CLIFun2.txt . Do you see the new file in the explorer?\n   If you do an ls -al you'll see there's now a CLIFun2.txt file with the same size as the CLIFun.txt file but with a more current timestamp.\n\n\nNow that we know how to copy files, let's try copying a directory as well. Change directory to \"CodingAndCocktails\" then type cp session3 session3-2 .\n   Oh no, we got an error! It looks like cp doesn't work with directories, but we can copy a directory by adding an option to cp. We'll add a -r for recursive.\n\n\nLet's try that again. Type cp -r session3 session3-2 . \n   Don't forget your tab completion!\n\n\nList the directory contents to make sure the copy worked by entering ls -al .\n   This time, you'll see a \"session3-2\" directory that's in the same as the directory we copied it from, except that it has a more current timestamp. You can also check it out in the explorer.\n\n\nTo remove the directory, use the recursive option again by typing rm -r session3-2 .\n   Be VERY careful when running rm commands. If you do it from the wrong directory, you could potentially remove your entire OS (Operating System, i.e. Windows or macOS) or other really important data!!\n\n\nNow let's move files. Navigate to the \"CodingAndCocktails\" directory and type mv session3/CLIFun2.txt . .\n   Remember, . is a shortcut for the current directory.\n\n   Where is your CLIFun2.txt file now? Verify your work by listing the directory contents and/or following along in the file explorer.\n\n\nLet's remove CLIFun2.txt by typing rm CLIFun2.txt . \n\nSometimes we need a reminder of all the different commands we used. We can use history command to help. Type `history .\n\nThere's a lot of commands in the terminal now and it looks a little cluttered. Let's clear it all out by using the clear command. Type clear .\n\n\n\n \nReferences and helpful links \nGNU/Linux Command-Line Summary on moving around the file system\n"},"ws2-inspect/":{"url":"ws2-inspect/","title":"Inspect a Git repo","keywords":"","body":"GitHub & Inspecting a Repository \nBeing able to keep track of changes in your source code is necessary.

Now we see more details about each commit such as \n\n  \n  1\n\nThe selected branch\n\n  \n  2\n\nThe author, date, and author's message about the changes\n\n  \n  3\n\nFurther actions you can take on a commit\n  \n\nLet's dive a little deeper and focus on circle #3. There's 3 actions you can take. Click on the middle button (the one with letters and numbers) on the first commit.\n It might look like random letters and numbers, but it's not! This is the unique identifier to the commit.\n\n\nYou now see the differences between the previous version and this commit. \n\nThe pink highlights show the previous version and the light green highlights are the new version. The darker red highlights shows the deleted characters and the dark green highlights show the added characters.\nThis is more commonly known by its abbreviated name, \"diff view\".\n\n\nClick the  button in Chrome to navigate back to the list of commits.\n\nIn the further actions you can take on a commit (circle #3), click on the button to the right (the one that looks like ). Now you are browsing the repository files as they were in this commit. You have a snapshot of the entire repository on every commit!\n\nClick the name of the repository \"DrinkOrderApp\" at the top of the page to navigate back to the main repository page.\n\n\nClone a repository  \nLet's look at the same repository using a Git GUI tool called GitKraken. We'll clone the repository to our machines and see a unified visualization of the separate branches and commits we inspected earlier. \n\nIn Chrome, on the main overview page for \"DrinkOrderApp\" repository, click on the green Clone or download button and click the  button to copy the link to the repository.\n\n\nOpen GitKraken. Clone a repository in GitKraken by selecting File  Clone Repo. \n\nIn the Repository Management dialog that displays, select Clone with URL. Click on Browse. Navigate to and select the \"CodingAndCocktails/session3\" folder to populate the Where to clone to field.\n\nWindows users - Navigate to your home directory by typing %USERPROFILE% in the file explorer navigation bar.\n \n\nPaste the link to the repository in the URL field. GitKraken will display the a Full path field. Notice it automatically adds the name of the repository to the path. Click Clone the repo!. \n\nWhen the banner with the text \"Successfully cloned repo 'DrinkOrderApp'\" displays, click on Open Now.\n\nWhen the repository opens, notice it looks almost like what we saw in GitHub with a lot of the same information. We see\n\n  \n  1\n\nRepository name and selected branch\n\n  \n  2\n\nA list of all branches in the repository\n\n  \n  3\n\nA commit for a branch along with author, message, modified date, and unique identifier\n\n  \n  4\n\nList of files modified\n\n  \n  5\n\nThe paths for all the branches as an unified view (aka a graph and \"Git tree\")\n\n\nTake a look at the list branches available in the repository (circle #2). Click on a different branch in the list, such as the one named \"jquery-master\". Notice a different commit highlights and the commit information on the right (circle #3) changes. Feel free to click on different branches (you can't break anything).\nRight click shows more options. We won't cover using them in GitKraken but you'll use some of the concepts later in the session.\n \n\nSelect a file from the list of files modified (circle #4). The main view changes to show the \"diff view\" like we saw in GitHub. Click on the \"X\" at the top of the main view above the checkbox for Ignore white space to return to the graph view. \n\n\nDouble click on a branch, such as the one named \"jquery-master\". Notice your selected branch changed (circle #1). You may have also noticed a message appear and disappear. You switched branches and the LOCAL list of branches on the list now contains \"jquery-master\". We'll cover more about this a little later tonight. \n\nNow let's turn our attention towards the Git tree. This shows all the branches in an unified view and how each path converges and diverges. Each branch is a different color. Circles with pictures and solid circles represent different commits. \nIt looks like a maze, but using this view we can trace revisions and see how a change affects the project as a whole. The ability to create branches in version control allows large groups of people can work independently and still collaborate on a single project.    \n \n\nRight click on \"jquery-master\" in the left panel with the list of all the branches. Select Solo as shown in the picture below.\n\nThe tree view zooms in and only displays the \"jquery-master\" branch. Select Solo again to revert to the tree view.\nTargeting one branch in a view makes identifying changes easier. This is the same view we had in GitHub when we saw all the commits for the selected branch.\n \n\nIn your terminal, navigate to \"CodingAndCocktails/session3\" directory and list the files to see your new repo. Notice GitKraken created a folder with the same name as the repository you cloned, \"DrinkOrderApp\".\n \n\nNeed a little help? Expand this section for guidance. \n\nUse the pwd command to determine which folder you are in. Change directories using the cd command. Remember you can move up a directory using cd ... Then use the ls command to list out the files and folders.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nReferences and helpful links \nAtlassian Git Tutorial-- What is version control\n"},"ws3-create/":{"url":"ws3-create/","title":"Create your own repo","keywords":"","body":"Creating a repository and commit changes \nWe'll create our own repository and commit changes to source files.

Use CTRL + ] to exit. \nMacWindowsType telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl .Enable telnet by following the video below, then type winpty telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl .  \n  \n  \n    To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that\n    supports HTML5 video\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n The telnet command uses a protocol that allows you to log in to another remote machine, located in this case at towel.blinkenlights.nl. A protocol is a set of procedures and rules for data transmission.\nThe winpty command allows Cmder to properly use the telnet command in Windows. You could also run telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl in the built-in Windows command prompt to get the same results.\n\n\n\nWindows users only - Learn some native Windows shell commands\nThere may be times when you don't have the bash shell. Windows PowerShell is the next best option for ongoing needs because it has more bash commands built in, but it's good to have exposure to Windows cmd. \nLet's learn some Windows shell commands that match some commands we learned in the worksheet. You can try stepping through command line portion of the worksheet using Windows command prompt but you will run into differences. Understanding the difference of a few basic commands may be helpful.\n\nOpen Windows command prompt by typing \"cmd\" in the Windows task bar. Launch Command Prompt Desktop app as an Administrator to try using native Windows commands.\nNot all of the bash commands are available in Windows.\n\n\nHere's some equivalent commands from bash to Windows command prompt.\n\n\n\nbash\ncmd\n\n\n\n\npwd\ncd\n\n\nls\ndir\n\n\ncd\ncd\n\n\n~\n%USERPROFILE%\n\n\nmkdir\nmkdir\n\n\ncp\ncopy\n\n\ncp -r\nxcopy\n\n\nmv\nmove\n\n\nrm\ndel\n\n\nrm -rf\ndeltree\n\n\n\nYou can find more equivalent commands here.\n\nPlay some games\n\nBeat the game at http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/. You'll start by entering in the command ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org  and typing bandit0 as the password when prompted.\n The ssh command stands for secure shell and is a network protocol, much like telnet.\n\n The higher levels of this game can get decently advanced but take it step by step. You can follow the walk through at https://www.yalpski.net/bandit-wargame for levels 0-17 if you need further help.
