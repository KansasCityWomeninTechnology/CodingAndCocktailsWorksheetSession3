## Use telnet
Ever wondered what _Star Wars: Episode IV_ would look like in all text? Of course you have!
1. Follow the instructions for your OS. Use `CTRL` + `]` to exit. 

   {% tabs first="Macs", second="Windows" %}

    {% content "first" %}
Type `telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl` <i class="fa fa-share fa-rotate-180"></i>.

    {% content "second" %}
Enable telnet by following the video below, then type `winpty telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl` <i class="fa fa-share fa-rotate-180"></i>.
{% raw %}
  <video id="enable-telnet" class="video-js" controls preload="auto" width="900" height="600"
  poster="enable-telnet.jpg" data-setup="{}">
  <source src="videos/enable-telnet.mp4" type='video/mp4'>
  <p class="vjs-no-js">

  </p>
  </video>
{% endraw %}

    {% endtabs %}

    {% hint style='info' %}
The `telnet` command uses a **protocol** that allows you to log in to another remote machine, located in this case at towel.blinkenlights.nl. A protocol is a set of procedures and rules for data transmission.

The `winpty` command allows Cmder to properly use the `telnet` command in Windows. You could also run `telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl` in the built-in Windows command prompt to get the same results.

## Windows users only - Learn some native Windows shell commands
There may be times when you don't have the bash shell. Windows PowerShell is the next best option for ongoing needs, but it's good to have exposure to Windows cmd. 

Let's learn some Windows shell commands that match our worksheet work. You can try working through the worksheet using Windows command prompt but you will run into differences quickly. Understanding the difference in a few basic commands may be helpful.

1. Open Windows command prompt by typing "cmd" in the Windows task bar. Launch **Command Prompt Desktop app** as an Administrator.
   {% hint style='info' %}
Not all of the bash commands are available in Windows. Windows PowerShell will have more bash commands.
   {% endhint %}


Here's some equivalent commands from bash to Windows command prompt.

| bash | cmd |
| --- | --- |
| pwd | cd |
| ls | dir | 
| cd | cd |
| ~ | %USERPROFILE% | 
| mkdir | mkdir |
| cp | copy |
| cp -r | xcopy |
| mv | move |
| rm | del |
| rm -r | deltree |
| echo | echo |
| cat | type |
|  > | > |
| >> | >> | 
| export MY_VAR | set MY_VAR |
| echo $MY_VAR | echo %MY_VAR%
| export | set |

## More Practice

1. Work through the Command Line course on Codecademy at [https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line).

1. Beat the game at [http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/). You'll start by entering in the command `ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org` <i class="fa fa-share fa-rotate-180"></i> and typing `bandit0` as the password when prompted.
    {% hint style='info' %}
The `ssh` command stands for **s**ecure **sh**ell and is a network protocol, much like `telnet`.
    {% endhint %}
    {% hint style='tip' %}
The higher levels of this game can get decently advanced but take it step by step. You can follow the walk through at [https://www.yalpski.net/bandit-wargame](https://www.yalpski.net/bandit-wargame) for levels 0-17 if you need further help. Always search the internet for anything you don't understand or need further information on!
