# Command Line Basics {#top}
The command line is another way to navigate your computer's directory structure and issue commands. Typically, you have a **GUI**, or **G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface, available to you. Why use a **CLI **\(**C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface\)? Because it's faster, uses fewer resources, and is much more powerful than a GUI! Let's take a look at how to orient yourself at the command line.
{% hint style='info' %}
The terms CLI and terminal are interchangeable.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style='tip' %}

{% endhint %}
