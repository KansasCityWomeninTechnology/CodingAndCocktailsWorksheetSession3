1. Change into your home folder by typing `cd ~`![](images/enter.png). Type `ls -al` ![](images/enter.png) to check if a **CodingAndCocktails** folder already exists.

2. Change directory into your CodingAndCocktails folder and create a **CommandLineBasics** folder by typing in `mkdir CommandLineBasics` ![](images/enter.png).

3. Then change into your newly created directory by typing `cd CommandLineBasics` ![](images/enter.png).

4. Let's create a file by typing `touch CLIFun.txt` ![](images/enter.png).
    {% hint style='info' %}
If you go to that same location through your GUI like you might be more used to, you'll see the file created there as a visual representation. You open the current directory you're in on a Mac by using `open .`. On a Windows machine, `start .` will do the same. In Cloud9 you'll see the file by opening the folders on the left side of your screen.
    {% endhint %}
