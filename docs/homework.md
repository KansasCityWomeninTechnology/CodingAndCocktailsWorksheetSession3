1. Beat the game at [http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/). You'll start by entering in the command `ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org` <i class="fa fa-share fa-rotate-180"></i> and typing `bandit0` as the password when prompted.

The `ssh` command stands for **s**ecure **sh**ell and is a network protocol, much like `telnet`.

    {% hint style='tip' %}
The higher levels of this game can get decently advanced but take it step by step. You can follow the walkthrough at [https://www.yalpski.net/bandit-wargame](https://www.yalpski.net/bandit-wargame) for levels 0-17 if you need further help. Always seach the internet for anything you don't understand or need further information on!
