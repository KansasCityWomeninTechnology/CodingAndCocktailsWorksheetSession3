# Command Line Practice

Let’s have some practice working with the filesystem so you can feel more confident coding on your own!

1.  Navigate to your home directory (hint: check the cheat sheet for the home directory shortcut)
2.  Check to see if you have a CodingAndCocktails directory created
3.  Change into the CodingAndCocktails directory
4.  Create a file called that contains 10 lines of text - perhaps ten types of Valentine’s candy??
5.  Display the first 3 lines of the file
6.  Display the last 3 lines of the file
7.  Check the size of the file
8.  Check the wordcount of the file
9.  Search the file for a particular word or part of a word.
10.  Create another file without any content
11.  Rename that file using the mv command
12.  Remove that file from the directory
